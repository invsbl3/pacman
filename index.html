        here the html is responsible to load all scripts
        and to use them...
        so, when "game.js" wants to load something from "maps.js"
        we don't need to import "maps.js" in "game.js"
        but HTML loads in sequence, so, if "first_script.js"needs
        something from "last_script.js", we have to re-aranje things.
        
        search about (js - hoisting), took me a long time to debug
        things related to js running/compile/execution time;
        (compile/running time differs in between languages a lot.)
