        here the html is responsible to load all scripts
        and to use them...
        so, when "game.js" wants to load something from "maps.js"
        we don't need to import "maps.js" in "game.js"

        I also putted the "game.js" as last to load because
        we just want the game to run if everything was fine
        I don't know if html load stuff in sequence, but at least
        it's well organized
        (compile/running time differs in between languages a lot.)
