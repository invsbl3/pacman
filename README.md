## About
I took my time to learn a lot of things about JS and some of HTML, had some trouble with problems that aparrently only JS has in its execution/compile times and routines...

And that's very hard to handle collisions and movement.

Very hard, I can now imagine how hard it is to make a good 3D clipping with optimized less than possible calculations...

## Next
Probably Tetris, but maybe in another language.
